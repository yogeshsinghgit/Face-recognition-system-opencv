#  Face Recognition System using Opencv

## About
This is a simple GUI Project to detect and recognize faces.

## Required Modules:

 - tkinter
 - os
 - openCV
 - Numpy
 
 ## Installation:
 tkinter and os are built in modules so we didn't require to install them seperately.
opencv and numpy are external modules so we have to install them using the command,

    pip install opencv-python
[opencv-python · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

The numpy module will automatically download with the opencv module but if not then use the command,

    pip install numpy

Now we have to install one more opencv package named opencv-contrib-python, because for our face recognition process we require one of its class.

    pip install opencv-contrib-python

[opencv-contrib-python · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)

## Note:
You have to create a folder named **dataset** in your working directory in which the dataset will be saved for face recognition process or you can say ML model Training Process.
